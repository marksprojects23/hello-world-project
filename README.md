# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to build a solid foundation in development by learning various programming languages and environments. This "Hello World" project serves as a basic yet significant step towards improving my coding skills. It demonstrates my ability to set up a development environment and successfully write and execute code that prints a message to the console. 

This software is a simple console application that outputs "Hello World! From Mark Cuizon". It provides a foundation for future projects that I will develop as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

The purpose of this software is to reinforce the initial steps in setting up a coding environment, managing source code via GitHub, and gaining confidence in writing, running, and demonstrating software projects.

# Development Environment

- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was used to write the code and manage files.
- **Version Control**: Git was used for version control, and GitHub was used for source code hosting.
- **Operating System**: The software was developed on a Windows 10 machine.

# Programming Language

This project was developed using Python. The language was chosen for its simplicity and ability to get a project up and running quickly, making it an ideal choice for this initial task.
